## Game Info

In the level 'Beat the dogs' there are citizens coming out of their homes for something to eat. They grab a bite from the food stand and go find a bench to sit and eat before heading back home. It is the players job to stop the dogs from terrorizing the people so they can eat in peace. 

The player can be merciless and just shoot the dogs, or they can be merciful and distract the dogs by taking chase off them. A counter informs the player of how many dogs are chasing, the more dogs the more points, and the longer the chase, the more points. There is ham in the green bins which the player can pick up and throw to the dogs which will cause them to stop chasing the player and eat the ham. Once the ham is eaten the dogs will roam about again and can chase the player again.

The player can choose to practice shooting in the level 'Target practice' and the player can practice running on the 'Don't fall' level.
